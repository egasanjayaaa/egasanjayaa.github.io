            <p>
You're growing up today, an age where the times that have passed and are yet to come feel so enjoyable, don't they?            </p>
            <p>
On this very special day, just like in previous years, I hope you will be happier and that all positive things will always follow you.            </p>
            <p class="separator">
Thank you for living until now and for accompanying me. I hope that God will always make your life easier and that all your wishes will come true :D            </p>
            <p>
And finally, thank you for everything. Even though it was a small thing you gave me, it meant a lot. Your parents must be proud to have you, Etha.            </p>
            <p class="signature">
Take care of yourself, you deserve the best.        </div>
